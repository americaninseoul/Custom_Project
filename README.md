A fun side project created during my down time at BYU Law. This tool takes the Desktop Goose app for Mac (https://desktop-goose.en.softonic.com/mac), replicates it, and asks each goose to steal the cursor over and over again. A more malicious version of the original idea, in short. If adjusted correctly (increasing amount of geese copied) the program can take up all of the host's memory and force a crash.
